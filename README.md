# Spell Timer for League of Legends

### This application is written in Visual Basic .NET using Visual Studio 2017. I made this application before I learned programming at school. 

##### Motivation:
I was playing an online video game called League of Legends and felt the need to check the times for the spells used in the game to improve my winrate in the game. But there was no such application to check the spell times, so I decided to make one myself. This application works, but the codes are sloppy and unorganized since I had no knowledge in programming.

##### What it does:
This application checks the times for spells or monster regeneration times for the online video game called [League of Legends](leagueoflegends.com).

##### How it works:
1. Before the game starts, set up the players' spells under SETTINGS.
2. Whenever a player uses a spell in the game or a monster gets killed, start the timer by pressing the play button accordingly. 
3. If you pressed the play button late, you can rewind the timer by using rewind button.
4. To abort the timer, press the stop button.
